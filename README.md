# AdventureStory
A project I made using a Udemy Course on Unity Game Development
It features classic RPG gameplay, and turn-based combat.

It is not fully polished, and there is only one level, but the basics are there.
It features an inventory, leveling, stats and items. 
## Usage
To play AdventureStory, first clone the repository, then un-zip the Adventure story zip file, open the .exe file inside and the game will run.
